<h2><b>Theme</b></h2>
<p><b><i>Berserk</i></b> explores a wide range of theme and topics. Free will, Destiny, Human nature, Morality... are few examples of the complexity and richness of the manga. In the manga, the characters<br/> 
always follow their will, their emotions. There is no manicheism. There is no <b>right</b> or <b>wrong</b> in <b><i>Berserk</i></b>, only Free will, emotion and violence.</p>
<p>Friendship, Human relations and Love are also explored themes in <b><i>Berserk</i></b>. <b>Guts</b> lived a traumatic experience with the mercenary group that raised him. Since this, he has lost trust in people.<br/>
But in <b><i>The Band of the Hawk</i></b> he has found bonds, friendship, animosities and co-dependencies, maturing as an individual. In parallel, the other characters will also evolve through their<br/> 
interactions with <b>Guts</b>. <b>Casca</b> for example, <b>Griffith</b>'s first lieutenant, will discover that she also has a <b>Dream</b>.</p>
<p>The Religion is also another main theme in the series. Through multiple characters, <b><i>Berserk</i></b> speaks about religious fanatism, intolerance and the antagonism between Pagan Religions and<br/>
Monotheistic Religion.</p>
